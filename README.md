# Sample App 1 - Network programming and JSON data retrieval 

This is a test app I developed for FuzzProductions. The goal is the create an app that
retrieves JSON data from URL links and display them on Android. 

Added features are buttons that filter the type of contents being shown on the list like
"TEXT" "ALL" or "IMAGES". For "Image" items, I added thumbnails on each item for better 
viewing experience and clicking on it will open up a DialogFragment with the image
resized to fit the screen while retaining its original proportion.
